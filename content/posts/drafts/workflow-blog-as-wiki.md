## Problem

- problem with multiple apps for saving notes - you don't open them and notes get forgotten
- tried every note-taking app for this (Notion, Bear) even Airtable
- Notion is my fave for lots of things, but doesn't work well as a wiki for me (I don't look)
- so many other apps already open and on the screen as I work

## Solution

- use blog as public reference
- key = change idea of it from a chronological timeline of new posts, to a set of tagged forever posts
- use my blog as my wiki

## Benefits

- one place for everything
- motivated to keep it up to date since it's public
- sharing knowledge hopefully helps other devs
- publicizing all the research and learning I do privately helps communicate expertise and effort to employers they wouldn't otherwise be aware of

## Process

- consume
- capture thoughts
- repeat
- when enough thoughts, draft, edit + publish
- when I learn something that updates it, update it + publish immediately
- repeat forever
