Tips:

- Write for one person (not everyone): https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1262415197345636353
- Put main ideas in headings: https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1262756496162476033

"If someone at work asks you a question about testing a react component, then maybe you can share your answer in a public gist on GitHub and send it to your co-worker as well as twitter. Just an idea there. I do this ALL. THE. TIME." -- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building

- assemble my faves by clearing "tools.vs-code" in Pocket
- keep adding over time (and tweet when I add a new batch)
- for updating, create a draft copy to batch updates + copy/paste them into the published post once they've been polished?
