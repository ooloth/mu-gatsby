"If someone at work asks you a question about testing a react component, then maybe you can share your answer in a public gist on GitHub and send it to your co-worker as well as twitter. Just an idea there. I do this ALL. THE. TIME." -- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building

### Inserting text

Unlike most editors, in Vim's normal mode, your cursor is always directly on top of a character. That's why the idea of inserting text before or after the cursor becomes relevant in vim.

- insert before cursor: i, I
- insert after cursor: a, A

### Deleting text

- d
- dw - doesn't mean "delete a word"; it means "put me in delete-what-ever-i-touch mode and then move to the next word"; or, "turn my cursor into a force that _deletes_ anything it travels through and then travel to the beginning of the next word"; so, you're really just moving the cursor and having a "delete" effect on whatever you pass on your journey; it's kind of like being in star mode in mario :)

### Changing text

- c, r
