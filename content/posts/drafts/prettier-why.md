- refactor example from bad to good?

- separate linting post(s) from formatting post(s)?

- changed something in GT and didn't realize it broke something else that was working before (go back and look up the reported issue - I think it related to wrong YAML formatting)
- show the linting rules I added to prevent that from happening again (had it in my editor, but not in the repo itself or running on GitHub PRs)
- step 1: how to add to repo
- step 2: how to add to GitHub (second post)
