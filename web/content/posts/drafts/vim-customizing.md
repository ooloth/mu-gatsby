"If someone at work asks you a question about testing a react component, then maybe you can share your answer in a public gist on GitHub and send it to your co-worker as well as twitter. Just an idea there. I do this ALL. THE. TIME." -- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building

- assumes using vim in terminal (though a lot of these customizations can be applied in vs code as well if using the plugin)
- why? vs code conveniences are helpful, so want to keep the useful editor hints and assistance I like from there
- how? vimrc file
- settings vs. plugins
- link to my vimrc file (commented to explain what each setting and plugin does)
- if you want to just read the whole file yourself, there you go
- if you want an explanation of what it includes, read on
- settings: show inline code excerpt and what I've done (show images of before and after effect on the editor)
- plugins: show inline code excerpt and what I've done (show images of before and after effect on the editor)
- neovim?

- relative line numbers
