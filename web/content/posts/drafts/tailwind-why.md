MU - migrate Styled Components to Tailwind (write about why + how!)

https://dev.to/jakedohm_34/using-tailwind-with-gatsby-js-10fj

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/

- Now automatic tree-shaking (purging unused styles) in production
- FEWER declarations than possible with css-in-js
- no runtime
- no style.js files ever (or, much shorter component files if you keep your styles in the same file as the component)
- easier to grok whatâ€™s happening once you learn the syntax
- faster dev (stay in one file)
- you get REALLY fast at this

- refactor example from bad to good?
