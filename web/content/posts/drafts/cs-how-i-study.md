Tips:

- Write for one person (not everyone): https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1262415197345636353
- Put main ideas in headings: https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1262756496162476033

-->

- don't struggle too long!
- if I don't know what to do, look it up right away and absorb the solution
- all of the questions already have optimized, known solutions
- it's inefficient to spend all my time going down the wrong road and building the wrong muscle memory
- memorize the right patterns + learn to recognize what questions they apply to
- same as I did when studying accounting in < 2 yrs
