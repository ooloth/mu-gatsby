"If someone at work asks you a question about testing a react component, then maybe you can share your answer in a public gist on GitHub and send it to your co-worker as well as twitter. Just an idea there. I do this ALL. THE. TIME." -- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building

- shoulder and wrists hurting because of trackpad and mouse use
- stop using mouse and keep hands on keyboard
- even better, keep hands near home row and type as few characters as possible to move around
- also switched from trackpad to vertical mouse + bought a more ergnomicly shaped keyboard
- after I started learning vim for RSI reasons, i became aware of how many repetitive clicks I was used to doing to move around the current file and between files; really cool to discover how quickly and easily i could jump around and edit text instead (productivity bonus)
